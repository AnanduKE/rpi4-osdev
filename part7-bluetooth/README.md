Writing a "bare metal" operating system for Raspberry Pi 4 (Part 7)
===================================================================

Getting Bluetooth up
--------------------

Controlling the RPi4 solely via a UART-connected laptop is not much fun. Our Breakout game deserves a better controller than that - ideally a wireless one.

In this part, we set up a second UART to communicate with the RPi4's onboard Bluetooth modem. There is nothing simple about Bluetooth, but it is at least simpler than USB, and that's the reason I've chosen to pursue it.
